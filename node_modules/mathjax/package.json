  "readme": "# MathJax\n\n## Beautiful math in all browsers\n\nMathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and\nAsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.  It was designed with\nthe goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a\nsingle, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers\nand operating systems.  It requires no setup on the part of the user (no\nplugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write\nweb documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be\nable to view it naturally and easily.  Simply include MathJax and some\nmathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.\n\nSome of the main features of MathJax include:\n\n- High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages\n\n- Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special\n  setup for the reader\n\n- Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers\n\n- Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other\n  advanced functionality\n\n- Powerful API for integration with other web applications\n\nSee <http://www.mathjax.org/> for additional details.\n\n\n## Installation and Usage\n\nThe MathJax installation and usage documentation is available in a\nseparate GitHub repository at <https://github.com/mathjax/mathjax-docs>.\nThe HTML versions can now be viewed at <http://docs.mathjax.org/>, \nwhere it is possible for you to submit corrections and modifications\ndirectly to the documentation on line.\n\n\n## Community\n\nThe main MathJax website is <http://www.mathjax.org>, and it includes\nannouncements and other important information.  MathJax is maintained and\ndistributed on GitHub at <http://github.com/mathjax/MathJax>.  A user forum\nfor asking questions and getting assistance is hosted at Google, and the\nbug tracker is hosted at GitHub:\n\nBug tracker:         <https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax/issues>  \nMathJax-Users Group: <http://groups.google.com/group/mathjax-users>\n\nBefore reporting a bug, please check that it has not already been reported.\nAlso, please use the bug tracker for reporting bugs rather than the help forum.\n",
